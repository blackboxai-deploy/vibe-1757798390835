Got a situation that needs your particular set of skills. The Kozlov crew has been moving product through OUR warehouse on the east side. This is unacceptable.

Job Details:
- Location: East Side Industrial Complex
- Target: 5-8 Kozlov soldiers
- Objective: Clear them out permanently
- Time Limit: 48 hours

Payment: $15,000 cash + 20% of recovered merchandise

This is a test of your capabilities. Prove yourself here, and bigger opportunities will follow. Fail, and you'll be swimming with the fishes.

Clean and quiet preferred, but loud works too. Your choice.

Don't disappoint me.

My sources have uncovered some interesting developments in the local business landscape:

OPPORTUNITIES:
‚Ä¢ The Diamond District is experiencing a power vacuum after the recent "incident"
‚Ä¢ Port Authority contracts are up for grabs - insider says bidding is rigged
‚Ä¢ New money laundering operation needs experienced partners
‚Ä¢ Underground fight club looking for backers with muscle

THREATS:
‚Ä¢ FBI task force increased surveillance in financial district
‚Ä¢ Dmitri's crew is recruiting heavily - planning something big
‚Ä¢ Police Chief got a budget increase - more heat coming our way

MARKET INTEL:
‚Ä¢ Weapon prices up 15% due to supply chain "disruptions"
‚Ä¢ Real estate values in contested territories dropped 30%
‚Ä¢ Crypto payments now preferred for offshore transactions

This information is worth $5,000. Pay up, and I'll keep you in the loop.

Stay informed or stay dead.

I hear you've been asking questions about my operations. This is your only warning.

The east side belongs to the Volkov family. Always has, always will. Your little friendship with that fish Vinny doesn't protect you here.

Cross into my territory, and you'll learn why they call me "The Hammer." I've buried bigger fish than you in shallow graves.

Stick to your side of town, and we won't have problems.

But if you're feeling brave... I'll be waiting.
